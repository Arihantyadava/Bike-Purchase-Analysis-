# Bike-Purchase-Analysis – Excel Project

This is a simple but powerful Excel project where I analyzed bike sales data to find useful business insights. The goal was to understand things like who buys bikes, where they buy them, and what factors influence those sales.

What’s Inside:

A clean, organized dataset

An interactive Excel dashboard with filters and charts

Visuals showing:

Customer age, gender, and income

Which products sell the most

Sales trends by region and state

How commute distance relates to bike ownership



What I Used:

Microsoft Excel

Pivot tables

Charts and graphs (bar, pie, line)

Slicers for easy filtering


Why I Made This:

I created this project to practice working with real-world data in Excel and to build a dashboard that makes it easy to spot trends and patterns in bike sales.
